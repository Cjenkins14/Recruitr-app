# Recruitr

https://recruitr-app.now.sh/

## Summary 

Recruitr was designed for college baseball recruiters, to minimize the work they do off the field.
Users are able to create profiles for their recruits, storing contact information as well as stats for
each player. Videos of the recruits playing can also be linked into the profiles as well. This solves
the problem of using various files and communication types to discuss and keep track of prospective 
recruits. Coaches as well as other recruiters can view all the teams prospects in one place. 

## Technologies
This project utitlizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Express.
